## Built by University Students

An experimental project exploring how AI coding assistants can transform open source development. We're learning modern React patterns while building components optimized for agentic workflows with tools like Claude Code.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @bitbybit-b3/elements-react
```

```tsx
import { Button } from '@bitbybit-b3/elements-react';

function App() {
  return <Button variant="default">Click me</Button>;
}
```
