## Built by Real Developers

These aren't just example components - they're the same components we use in our production applications. We share them as we build and improve them for our own projects.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @bitbybit-b3/elements-react
```

```tsx
import { Button } from '@bitbybit-b3/elements-react';

function App() {
  return <Button variant="default">Click me</Button>;
}
```

## About BitByBit-B3

We're a team of developers building real-world applications. As we build, we create and refine components. Instead of keeping them private, we share them with the community.
